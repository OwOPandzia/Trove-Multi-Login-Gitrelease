v2.3 Changelog:
- Account login system recieved a major overhaul, now based on iteration instead of selection.
- Changed method for finding what language Glyph is using (name for the Login popup)
- WindowMoving has been converted to an array call which enabled the drastic reduction in filesize.
- Login error handling slightly changed to improve detection.
- Error_Display and other external scripts have been modified to increase efficiency.
- Reformed exitclass.DoBeforeExit to remove both shift, control partial keypresses from an interrupted ControlSend.
- Increased delays to reduce crashes

Problems:
- Clients may still crash during the Login period, a problem likely both with the mindowmoving and naming and the program itself, 
  considering making this into a timer looping through an array to interact with the windows after a certain time while still logging 
  in other accounts to reduce wasted runtime.
