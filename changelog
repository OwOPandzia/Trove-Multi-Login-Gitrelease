[2.2] Changelog:

Intro:
Had caffeine withdrawl for a few days, got my fix and went mad and did this among other things.
Started using Visual Studio Code to do AHK and other languages and it's so much nicer than Notepad++ as it gives the preview of the zoomed out code on the right hand side and it's easier on my eyes, better syntax highlighting and easy file renaming and addition etc.
The extention i used (Visual Studo Code and extensions are free): https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=slevesque.vscode-autohotkey
Was thinking about adding password encryption that is "randomly" generated on first run but had problems doing it and gave up. Was thinking of getting two arrays of characters, one as they key, with the key saved in a file to be decoded to the clipboard but maybe I'll add that later.
TL;DR: I'm a noob at arrays in AHK.
Was taking a break from study to do this for a few solid hours so don't expect much in the future.

Changes:
-Added "Error_Display.ahk" which I'm using (to some extent) to display errors in a more user-friendly way
-Removed some parts of the startup which just added variables for no reason
-Added fancy magic code to header

-Changed check for crashed/closed clients to an individual level so the whole process isn't restarted
--Introduced a function (add_runnum) for adding to runnum to go through clients to launch
--window_setup now takes 2 parameters
--window_setup is now one big single loop so it can be broken out of

-Introduced a check for internet connectivity because my internet is a problem and it probably is for others
