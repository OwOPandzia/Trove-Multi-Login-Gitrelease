[B]I got bored for a few hours and prioritised this over pointless gaming.
Killed item delete since it was simply bad. 
I will try and incorporate Nippy's Boot Drop whenever I can be bothered to look into it. (Making my script less shite took a lot of caffeine)
I'll also be looking into reducing global variables for emails and passwords but that'll be a big task for the future, possibly.[/B]

[CENTER][SIZE=4]It may be obvious to some but I remind you to [B][COLOR="#FF0000"]use passwords for these accounts that are different to any other passwords you use[/COLOR][/B]. [COLOR="#FF0000"][B]These passwords are saved into a text file, copied to the clipboard for short periods of time and are NOT SECURED![/B][/COLOR][/SIZE][/CENTER]

Example of setup:

[B][U][SIZE=4]Current Issues:[/SIZE][/U][/B]
[SPOILER=Issues]- Reply with a description of the issue you are having, I will try to get back to you and fix it.
- If the program doesn't seem to click "play" on glyph, try increasing wait_for_glyph_to_login to a higher number (in miliseconds) for optimal use
- Passwords are as unsafe as can be, considering adding some sort of encrypttion in a later release
- Not tested much, spent 8 hours changing things and don't have the energy left

[SIZE=4][U][B]ChangeLog:[/B][/U][/SIZE]
[SPOILER=Changes]Changelog:
-majorly reduced email msgbox process because it was silly-long. Now it's just a variable in a messagebox.
-removed invdelete
-reduced setup for FishingBot and Openbackpack for the reason above
-set openbackpacks to a keybind (f3)
-changed the method of entering emails and passwords to saving them to the clipboard to paste in, after each email and password the clipboard is cleared
-shortened login_account(num) by calling another function
-included a check for missing clients, if so: close all and start them again
-included delays between moving windows and naming them, stopping as many crashes
-reduced the script length by over 1000 lines
-options_Gui and open_backpack are separate files, closing after 5 seconds if Glyph Login.ahk isn't running
-enough scripts to warrant a file for 

Changed nothing about the restarting system and nippy's fishing bot, so notify my in the comments if something's wrong with them.
